/**
 * Ref: https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/september-leetcoding-challenge/555/week-2-september-8th-september-14th/3458/
 * Given a set of non-overlapping intervals, insert a new interval into the intervals (merge if necessary).
 * <p>
 * You may assume that the intervals were initially sorted according to their start times.
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: intervals = [[1,3],[6,9]], newInterval = [2,5]
 * Output: [[1,5],[6,9]]
 * <p>
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input: intervals = [[1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16]], newInterval = [4,8]
 * Output: [[1,2],[3,10],[12,16]]
 * Explanation: Because the new interval [4,8] overlaps with [3,5],[6,7],[8,10].
 * NOTE: input types have been changed on April 15, 2019. Please reset to default code definition to get new method signature.
